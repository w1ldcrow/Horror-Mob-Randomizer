# Mob Name Randomizer

The Mob Name Randomizer project aimed to randomize various characteristics or images of monsters to generate new monster ideas for the horror game Midnight Tales, which is currently in development.

## Project Overview

The project consists of JavaScript functions to randomly select attributes for a monster. These attributes include image, personality, aggro behavior, sound sensitivity, sensitivity to light, low sanity bonus, clues, killability, damage, and movespeed.

The `randomSelect(array)` function is used to randomly select an element from an array, ensuring diversity in attribute selection.

## Usage

To use the Mob Name Randomizer, simply call the `generateMob()` function. This function selects random attributes for a monster and displays them, along with an associated image, on the web page.

## Example Output

Here is an example output generated by the Mob Name Randomizer:
